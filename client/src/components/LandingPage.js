            <p>Squad-Check is the only tool you'll need to keep track of your squads schedule,
                availability, and stats.
            </p>
            <p>Squad-Check is not just a game schedule, the site allows your teammates to 
                RSVP whether they're coming to the game or not so you don't have to contact everyone to 
                make sure they're coming.
            </p>
            <p>We also keep track of your teams stats for Hockey, Baseball, and Basketball.
                Once your game has passed, the team admin can update the stat lines for each player and 
                the result of your game which in turn will update your team's record.
            </p>
            <p>Play for multiple teams in multiple sports? We keep track of all your stats across
                every team, season, and sport you've played. As you create and join teams new stat lines 
                will be added to your profile page and updated as your seasons progress.
